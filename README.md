# ENGR 285 --- Project 1

This repository contains my group's work for Project 1 of my Engineering 285 class.
The assignment focuses on modeling predator-prey dynamics using the Lotka-Volterra Model.
The population data is generated using a [Wa-Tor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wa-Tor) simulation.

The document is created using [Typst](https://typst.app/).
A `makefile` is configured to run all the Python scripts in the `scripts` directory and save their text output in the `output` directory.
The scripts and output can then be included in the document as desired.
The `makefile` also compiles the Typst document into a PDF.
